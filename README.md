## Overview

The goal of this bundle is to provide a simple way to include public 3rd-party
libraries (javascripts, css, pictures ...) into your projects and keep its up-to-date.

1. Add the library to composer.json
2. Configure the library in PrestaComposerPublicBundle
3. Use the library as any other assets in the project.

## Why this bundle?

Because there's lot of meta bundles that provides libraries like jQuery, bootstrap
and only the most populars are maintain and up-to-date.
The probably fastest other way is to freeze the library into your project and sometimes hack it ...
Wait ?! nooooooo ! Nooooo!

So now make it better: start configure it using composer, use it as any other assets
and then keep it up-to-date simply with composer.
